# Diagrams
In chemistry, there are many types of diagrams used to illustrate important things. Two types of diagram we have learned about to represent an atom are the Bohr-Rutherford Diagram and the Electron Dot diagram

### Bohr-Rutherford Diagrams
In a Bohr-Rutherford diagram, the numbers of protons and neutrons ([see Parts of the Atom for more](https://dood393.github.io/studytool/Atom) about protons and neutrons) are represented in a central circle, while the number of electrons are shown as numbers or dots in a ceries of concentric energy levels.

### Electron Dot Diagrams
An Electron Dot diagram, ora Lewis Dot diagram, is almost perfect for someone in a rush. It is very simple. To design one, all you do is write the chemical symbol and surround it with a number of dots equal to the number of valence electrons.
